Okay, let's go through each commodity in your `COMMODITIES` list and determine where it's likely to be cheapest and most expensive based on the `econEffect` (price delta `dp`) and the `basePrice`.

We'll primarily look at the `dp` values. A more negative `dp` means cheaper (production/surplus), and a more positive `dp` means more expensive (consumption/demand). The `techAdj` also plays a role, making items slightly cheaper at higher TLs and slightly more expensive at lower TLs, but the `econEffect` is usually the dominant factor for "cheapest" and "most expensive" at a *specific type* of station.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Tech Level (`minTechLevel`):** Some commodities won't appear at all in low-tech stations. This analysis assumes the station *can* stock the item.
*   **Tech Level Adjustment (`techAdj`):** For a *given* economy type, a higher TL station will be slightly cheaper than a lower TL station of the *same* economy type, and vice-versa. I'll focus on the economy type for primary price differences.
*   **Random Jitter:** This adds minor fluctuations, so the "absolute" cheapest/most expensive might vary slightly.
*   **No `econEffect`:** If a commodity has no specific `econEffect` for certain economy types, its price there will be closer to its `basePrice` (modified only by `techAdj` and jitter).
*   **"Pirate" Economy:** This economy type isn't explicitly used in the `econEffect` of your current commodities, so prices there would be close to base, modified by `techAdj`.

Here's the breakdown:

---

**1. Water** (`basePrice: 3`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "Agricultural" (`dp: -1`), "Rich Agricultural" (`dp: -1`). Also "Poor Agricultural" (`dp: 0`, but higher quantity).

    *   **Most Expensive:** "Poor Agricultural" (`dp: +10`).

**12. Robots** (`basePrice: 1500`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -150`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** "Agricultural" (`dp: +80`).

**13. Computers** (`basePrice: 400`)

**14. Adv Components** (`basePrice: 1800`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -200`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** "Rich Industrial" (`dp: +100`).

**15. Luxuries** (`basePrice: 500`)

**16. Gem-Stones** (`basePrice: 80` per gram)
    *   **Cheapest:** Any station type *not* listed in its `econEffect` (e.g., Agricultural).
        *   *Slightly cheaper at higher TL stations of these types.*
    *   **Most Expensive:** "High Tech" (`dp: +15`).

**17. Gold** (`basePrice: 300` per kg)
    *   **Cheapest:** Any station type *not* listed in its `econEffect` (e.g., Agricultural).
        *   *Slightly cheaper at higher TL stations of these types.*
    *   **Most Expensive:** "High Tech" (`dp: +30`).

**18. Platinum** (`basePrice: 550` per kg)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -30`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** "Rich Industrial" (`dp: +20`).

**19. Firearms** (`basePrice: 300`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "Rich Industrial" (`dp: -30`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** Any station type *not* listed in its `econEffect` (e.g., Agricultural, High Tech).
        *   *Slightly more expensive at lower TL stations of these types.*

**20. Controlled Substances** (`basePrice: 2500`)

    *   **Most Expensive:** "Rich Industrial" (`dp: +200`).

**21. Alien Items** (`basePrice: 1200`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -150`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** Any station type *not* "High Tech".
        *   *Slightly more expensive at lower TL stations of these types.*

**22. Bio-Samples** (`basePrice: 3000`)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -300`).
    *   **Most Expensive:** Any station type *not* listed in `econEffect` (e.g. Industrial) or with a less negative `dp`.
        *   *Slightly more expensive at lower TL stations of these types.*

**23. Antimatter** (`basePrice: 8000` per gram)
    *   **Cheapest:** "High Tech" (`dp: -1000`). (Note: Only available at TL8).
    *   **Most Expensive:** Not practically sold elsewhere due to high `minTechLevel` and the strong `econEffect` making it almost exclusive to High Tech as a (relatively) lower price point. If another TL8 station existed without "High Tech" economy, it would be astronomically expensive.

This analysis should give you a good understanding of the trade dynamics for each commodity based on station economy. For players, the ideal trade route involves buying where `dp` is very negative (and quantity `qMult` is high) and selling where `dp` is very positive.
